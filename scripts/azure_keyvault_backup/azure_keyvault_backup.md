# 🔐 Azure Key Vault Backup Script for Dell PPDM Generic Application Protection

This document provides an overview, purpose, and detailed usage guide for the **Azure Key Vault Backup Script**, designed as a Generic Application integration for Dell PowerProtect Data Manager (PPDM).

---

## 📘 Overview

This Bash script automates the export of Azure Key Vault contents (secrets, certificates, and key metadata) for backup purposes. It runs as a PPDM Generic Application Protection job, enabling file-level backup of non-native or cloud applications.

It uses Azure CLI and a service principal with appropriate RBAC roles to perform **full backups** of all Key Vault objects in the target subscription.

## 🛡️ PPDM Generic Application Protection Context

PPDM’s Generic Application Protection supports custom workloads via scripts that interact with application data and store it on DD BoostFS targets.

This script:

- 📤 Exports Key Vault data to a specified directory
- 🔐 Uses PPDM environment variables for auth and paths
- 📋 Logs operations for visibility and troubleshooting
- 📦 Supports `FULL` backup level only

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Discovers all Key Vaults in the Azure subscription
- 📄 Exports:
  - 🔑 Secrets → `.txt` files
  - 📜 Certificates → `.pfx` files (base64 decoded)
  - 🧾 Keys → `.json` metadata
- 🔁 Log rotation for backup tracking
- ✅ Validates Azure roles and environment variables
- 🔐 Secure service principal authentication
- 📋 Detailed logging
- 🔗 Seamless PPDM integration

## 🏃 Scripted Installation Into PPDM using provided helper Function

Requires jq installed on the host

```bash
source ./helper/ppdm_functions.sh
export PPDM_FQDN=<ppdm.examle.com>
export PPDM_TOKEN=$(get_ppdm_token 'your password')  
# param args: each line name [ e.g -n],Default Value,Alias [parameter description], type[STRING,INTEGER,BOOLEAN,DATE,CREDENTIAL]
PARAM_ARGS=(
  "-t,'',TENANT_ID,STRING"
  "-s,'',SUBSCRIPTION_ID,STRING"
)

# set ppdm_scripts "filepath" "script name" "description" "parameter arguments"
set_ppdm_scripts \
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dell-examples/ppdm-generic-scripts/refs/heads/main/scripts/azure_keyvault_backup/azure_keyvault_backup.sh" \
  "azure_keyvault_backup" \
  "Script to backup Azure Keyvault in given Subscription" \
  "${PARAM_ARGS[@]}"
